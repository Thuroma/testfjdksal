        <p>
            I wanted to develop this tool for people like me who have a Zillow saved list created from a price range search.
            I had a list of houses I liked but I didn;t know anything about the area they were in.
            I wanted to know how close they were to places like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegan restaurants</li>
            <li>Dog parks</li>
            <li>City/State/National Parks</li>
            <li>Bike Trails</li>
            <li>Co-Ops</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>TODO</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish refactoring to Vue client and Django REST framework</li>
            <li>Host on Azure</li>
            <li>Develop Android app</li>
            <li>Link mobile app to Django REST framework to enable mobile pins</li>
        </ul>
